\title{## The function ggATAC from https://github.com/ices-eg/WGINOR/blob/main/TAF_ATAC/
The plotting is done using the [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
data = dataset with two columns: year and value
year_start = first year that is be used when fitting the models
year_end_trend = last year that is used when fitting the overall trend model (using all observations). By default this is the last year of the series
year_end_OL = last year that is used when fitting the model that is used for forecasting. By default this will be the last year of data minus the n years of forecasts
n_forecasts = number of forecasts to the produced. By default 3.}
\usage{
ggATAC(results, backtransform = FALSE, trend = FALSE, width)
}
